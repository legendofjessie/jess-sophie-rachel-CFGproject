<h2>About the Custard Cream</h2>

    <p>A Wikipedia description of a Custard Cream can be seen here:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custard">
    <i>"A custard cream is a type of biscuit popular in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.
    Its structure is that of a sandwich, with a creamy, custard-flavoured centre between two flat biscuit layers.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, the filling was buttercream (which is still used in home-made recipes) but nowadays cheaper fats have replaced butter in mass-produced biscuits. The filling tastes of vanilla and as such is more akin to the taste of custard made with custard powder than egg custard. 
    It is believed that the custard cream biscuit originated in Britain in 1908.</p> 
    They usually have an elaborate baroque design stamped onto them, originating in the Victorian era and representing ferns factory in Carlisle."</i></p></p></blockquote>

<h1><b>Did you know?:</h1></b>Studies show that the Custard Cream is both Britain's favourite biscuit, and the most dangerous biscuit you could eat. This is because hidden dangers include flying fragments and daredevil dunking in scalding tea.
<P>Around <b>500</b> people a year need hospital treatment because of biscuit injuries.</p>
<p>The first Custard Cream was created in 1908!</p>
